NCM Components
==============

## Description ##

Node Configuration Manager (NCM) components are Perl modules that run on 
each _managed_ Linux node to ensure the configuration matches what is
requested in the _profile._ Components are not executed standalone but
instead launched by [ncm-ncd](https://github.com/quattor/ncm-ncd).

They are part of [Quattor](www.quattor.org).
