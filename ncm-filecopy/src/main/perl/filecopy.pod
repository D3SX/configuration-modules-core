=head1 NAME

ncm-filecopy: NCM component to manage simple configuration files and services.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The I<filecopy> component manages services which have simple
configuration files (representated as strings in pan).  A "restart"
command can be given which will be run whenever the configuration
changes.  

Note: that this does not do any validation checking on the content of
the service configuration.  If this is desired, a service-specific
component should be written.

=head1 RESOURCES

=head2 /software/components/filecopy/forceRestart
A boolean that defines if the restart (if any defined) of the file(s) 
should be forced (otherwise it restart only if something has changed to 
either the permissions or the content). Defaults to false.

=head2 /software/components/filecopy/services

An nlist where the key is the encoded string of the configuration
filename.  The resource "config" contains the contents of the
configuration file and the resource "restart" contains a command to
execute on reconfiguration.  The owner, group and permissions can also be
given in the "owner", "group" and "perms" properties, respectively. "owner"
can be either a owner or 'owner:group'. The resource "config" will be encoded 
to utf8 except if a no_utf8 resource is set to true.

Also a 
per filename based "forceRestart" can be given to overwrite 
the component wide setting. 

By default, the component creates a backup of the file using the suffix .old. 
The backup can be suppressed by setting the optional field "backup" to false.
