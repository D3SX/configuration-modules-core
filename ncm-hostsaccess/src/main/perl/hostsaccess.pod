=head1 NAME

hostsaccess: NCM component to control /etc/hosts.allow and hosts.deny files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The I<hostsaccess> component manages the configuration files /etc/hosts.allow
and /etc/hosts.deny.  Few checks are done on the given configuration to 
allow all of the supported wildcarding. 

=head1 RESOURCES

=head2 /software/components/hostsaccess/allow

A list where each entry consists of a named list with the keys: daemon
and host.  Both of the keys take strings as values and hence can
support the full wildcarding syntax.  These entries are allowed to
access the daemon. 

NOTE: The daemon name MUST be encoded with the pan escape()
function. This allows daemon lists to be used in the specification. 

=head2 /software/components/hostsaccess/deny

A list where each entry consists of a named list with the keys: daemon
and host.  Both of the keys take strings as values and hence can
support the full wildcarding syntax.  These entries are denied access
to the daemon. 

NOTE: The daemon name MUST be encoded with the pan escape()
function. This allows daemon lists to be used in the specification. 

=head1 EXAMPLE

"/software/components/hostsaccess/allow" = push(nlist("daemon","slapd",
                                                 "host","127.0.0.1"));
