	* Release: 1.5.0
	- Add a hack to control which files should be managed by the
	component.

	CERN was using different tools for handling the
	.ssh/authorized_keys file, and was colliding with this
	component. The proper way to solve it would be by disabling
	this component on the affected users, but they needed it to
	control PAM ACLs. And PAM ACLs should be moved to a different
	component but that needs some time I don't have, so this is
	the quick hack.

	* Release: 1.4.6
	- Replacing "remove" with "unlink" to keep it more
	standard-perl-ish.

	* Release: 1.4.5
	- Fixing some crashes when the user's home dir is not
	writeable.

	To do it, I removed the use of LC::File::{remove,makedir}, as I
	don't have time to learn how to deal with exceptions on perl-LC.

	the user doesn't have any Kerberos or SSH settings no errors should be thrown.
